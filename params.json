I have decided to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).\r\n\r\n### Heroku\r\n* I had issues for packaging my application with _package.json_ (dependencies vs devDependencies)\r\n* Déploiement à partir de GitHub\r\n* I had issues with the port used by [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server). I had to create the config file _/bs-config.js_ at the root of my project.\r\n\r\n`module.exports = {\r\n    \"port\": process.env.PORT\r\n};`\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Unit tests\r\n\r\nI've decided to build small unit tests regarding the Coveo REST Search API and my challenge.\r\nHere's is the [source code](https://github.com/lgcarrier/js-challenge-saq/tree/master/testing)\r\n\r\n### Framework and libraries\r\n* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework\r\n* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) BDD / TDD assertion library\r\n* [Nightmare](http://www.nightmarejs.org/) browser automation library\r\n\r\n![Testing results](images/js-challenge-saq-test.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLouis-Guillaume Carrier-Bédard (@lgcarrier)\r\n",
